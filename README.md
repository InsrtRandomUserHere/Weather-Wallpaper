# Weatherpaper

Weather-Wallpaper changes your desktop wallpaper based on your current weather. This works by calling to a weather API and fetching the information there.

You can change the wallpapers set, these are just the ones I like. Weeby, I know.

Note: This project is built for **Windows 10**

# Requirements
1. Weather API - I suggest using [openweathermap](https://openweathermap.org/api)
2. [TranslucentTB](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/translucenttb/9PF4KZ2VN4W9) - To see the current weather text behind the taskbar


# How to set up

1. Once you get TranslucentTB, click on its icon on the bottom left, then select **Maximised window > Clear**
2. Set up your own API key from [openweathermap](https://openweathermap.org/current)
3. Change the variable values
4. Make other edits if you want
5. Enjoy

# Notes
- I didn't bother putting a wallpaper for snow because it doesn't snow from where I from. You can go ahead and put your own.
- [main.py](https://github.com/InsrtRandomUserHere/Weather-Wallpaper/blob/main/main.py "main.py") - Will change the wallpaper normally based on weather.
- [separated_day_and_night_clear.py](https://github.com/InsrtRandomUserHere/Weather-Wallpaper/blob/main/separated_day_and_night_clear.py "separated_day_and_night_clear.py") - Will do the same as the main one, except this one will have a separate wallpaper for `Clear` weather between day (6:00am-5:59pm) and night (6:00pm-5:59am)
- You can find all the weather types returned by openweatherapi [here](https://openweathermap.org/weather-conditions).
